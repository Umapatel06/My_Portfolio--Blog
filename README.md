# My_Portfolio-Blog
Welcome to my Portfolio & Blog project! This is a personal website that serves two main purposes:

1- Portfolio: A place to showcase my skills, projects, and achievements.
2- Blog: A space to share my thoughts, articles, and experiences related to software development and technology.

# Project Highlights
🎨 Portfolio Section
I've designed this section to highlight my key projects. Each project has a detailed description, the tech stack used, and links to live demos or GitHub repositories.
It also includes my skills, certifications, and some of my key achievements in tech.
✍️ Blog Section
A space where I write and share articles about coding, best practices, and my journey as a developer.
I've made it SEO-friendly, so the content is easier to find and engage with.
📩 Contact Form
This allows visitors to contact me directly. It's simple but functional, and the form sends me an email notification whenever there's a new message.
📱 Responsive Design
I’ve made sure the site works well across different devices, whether it’s a desktop, tablet, or mobile.
🛠 Admin Dashboard
There's a simple backend panel that helps me manage blog posts, portfolio content, and track messages from the contact form.
